Santa has found a weird device called an "Oxocard Blockly", which seems to display a sequence of images. He believes it
has got something to do with a QR code, but it doesn't seem complete...

You can't fly to the north pole, so Santa sent you a video of the device in action.

The elves are having a karaoke and left with in a hurry while singing into their micro. This means that they aren't
there to help him, so now is your chance to make a good impression and find the flag!

## Solution

We are given a video of an oxocard showing four parts of a QR code. We can simply cut the parts out and stitch them
together by hand. Finally, we need to find the right QR code scanner that can scan micro QR codes to obtain the flag:
`HV22{b0f}`.
