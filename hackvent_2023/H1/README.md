# H1 - Kringle's Secret

## Description

Level: Easy<br/>

## Solution

The first hidden flag could be found by running [zsteg](https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg) on the final picture obtained
in [HV06](../06/README.md). I used [Aperi'Solve](https://www.aperisolve.com/e411f809ce6014095aa01cc1f1ad00d4) since it
offers a web UI. This gave the flag `HV23{no_ctf_without_stego}`.
