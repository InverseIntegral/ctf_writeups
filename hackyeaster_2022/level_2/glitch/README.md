# Glitch

## Description
Level: noob<br/>
Author: PS

I got a flag, but it's glitched somehow.

```
}ɥɔʇᴉしƃ_ǝしʇʇᴉし_ɐ_ʇ己几ɾ{ᄅᄅ０ᄅǝɥ
```


## Solution

The flag seems to be upside down. [This online tool](https://www.upsidedowntext.com/) can be used to flip text upside
down and outputs:

```
he2０22}j几己t‾a‾しittしe‾gしitch{
```

From there we can guess the flag `he2022{just_a_little_glitch}`.
