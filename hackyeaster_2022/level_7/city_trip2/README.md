# City Trip 2

## Description
Level: hard<br/>
Author: PS

Later that year, I was travelling again. Find out where I shot this picture! This time, I want GPS coordinates.

## Solution

This challenge is similar to the previous city trip challenge. We are given a picture and have to find out where exactly
that place is.

First of all, we can see that the cars drive on the left side. Furthermore, there is a sign on the building to the right
with a phone number on it. This leads us to Manchester UK. But how can we find the exact place? The last hint that we
need from the picture is the tram line. With this we can simply follow all the lines on a map in Google Street View and
compare them.
