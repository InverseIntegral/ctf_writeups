# Rabbits With Hats

## Description
Level: easy<br/>
Author: PS

I'm looking for a friend of mine who had to flee from his evil owner.
He must have found a shelter for wildlife, but didn't tell me where it is. He just said he would go join **rabbits with
hats**. What the heck do these three words mean??

ðŸš© Flag

- he2022{nameoftheplace}
- all lowercase, no spaces
- first letter is j, last one is y
- e.g. he2022{junglezooaviary}

## Solution

This challenge took me quite a while to solve. It turns out that you can convert the three words **rabbits with hats**
into a location using [this online service](https://what3words.com/rabbits.with.hats). Close to that location there is
the "Jackrabbit Flat Wildlife Sanctuary" so the flag was `he2022{jackrabbitflatwildlifesanctuary}`.
