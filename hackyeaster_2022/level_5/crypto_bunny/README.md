## Solution

Opening the image in a text editor shows some interesting metadata:

```

```

It seems to be a badge that can be earned so I visited [the badgr
website](https://eu.badgr.com/public/badges/LaGEPKu1R2W5mg221vdV4g). There we can see the following description as well
as the earning criteria of the badge:

> Crypto Bunny Award, for the rabbit cipher masters only.

```

The earning criteria seems to be base64 encoded and the description of the badge hints at the rabbit cipher. Decoding
the criteria returns a string that starts with `Salted__` so I was quite sure that this must be some kind of ciphertext.
However, to decrypt the ciphertext I needed a password. This step took me a while to figure out. It turns out that the
tag of badge (carrot) was the key of the rabbit cipher. With the help of [this
tool](https://www.browserling.com/tools/rabbit-decrypt) I was able to decrypt the criteria and get the flag:
`he2022{b4dg3_4w4rd3d}`.
